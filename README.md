# Team Event Planning Project

## 1. Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to planning and organizing a hypothetical team-building event for a team of 10 people. The aim is to learn and practice using GitHub for project management workflows.

## 2. Project Goal
To successfully plan and detail all aspects of a team event, including objectives, logistics, budget, and agenda, within the next 3 weeks.

## 3. Key Deliverables
* Event Objectives and Theme
* Preliminary Guest List (10 people)
* Event Date & Time Selection
* Venue/Platform Research (e.g., virtual game platform, restaurant)
* Budget Estimate
* Detailed Agenda
* Communication Plan

## 4. Key Stakeholders
* Project Manager (That's you!)
* Hypothetical Team Members (attendees)
* Hypothetical Management (approvers)

## 5. Scope (In-Scope / Out-of-Scope)
**In-Scope:**
* Planning, organization, and documentation of the event.
* Defining all necessary logistical details.

**Out-of-Scope:**
* Actual execution of the event (this is a planning exercise only).
* Handling real financial transactions.

## 6. Project Status
**Phase:** Planning
**Current Focus:** Defining initial requirements and breaking down tasks.

## 7. How to "Contribute" (for learning purposes)
While this is a personal learning project, in a real scenario, this section would explain how team members can contribute (e.g., "Open an Issue for new ideas," "Submit a Pull Request for document updates").
